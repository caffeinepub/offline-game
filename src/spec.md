# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand the 2D game with difficulty levels, level progression, power-ups, audio, and visual themes.

**Planned changes:**
- Add difficulty selection (Easy, Medium, Hard) in main menu affecting obstacle spawn rate and speed
- Implement level progression system with increasing challenge based on score thresholds
- Add collectible power-ups (speed boost, shield, slow-motion) with temporary effects and visual indicators
- Integrate sound effects for key events and background music with volume controls
- Create distinct visual themes for different level ranges with unique color palettes

**User-visible outcome:** Players can select difficulty, progress through levels with unique themes, collect power-ups during gameplay, and enjoy audio feedback with customizable volume controls.
